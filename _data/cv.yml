      year: 2025 - Present
      title: Postdoctoral Experimental Physicist
      description:
        - Characterized two competing pendula designs using optical lever photodiode measurement, analyzed time-series data to determine pendula frequency using FFT signal analysis, then confirmed agreement with theoretical performance model.
        - Installed experimental equipment including pendulum in vacuum chamber containing trapped atoms using custom hardware for future tests of quantum decoherence via gravity.
        - Demonstrated the viability of torsional balance approach by implementing a real-time operating system that controls the torsional pendulum amplitude using optical feedback and collects the pendulum position data using an optical lever; results to be presented at the 2026 APS Global Summit and a journal publication is under preparation.
        - Supported ongoing collaboration between University of Maryland (Jacob Taylor's group), NIST (Jon Pratt's group) and UC Berkeley (Holger M\"uller's group) through meetings and on-site visits.
        - Supervised, trained, and mentored three undergraduate researchers in experimental design, fabrication, and fundamental laboratory skills.

      year: 2023 - 2024
      title: Geodetic Surveyor
      description:
        - Initiated effort towards a latitude-varying gravity calibration loop to meet the needs of the local survey team and reduce need for travel. 
        - Identified candidate locations suitable for gravity calibration loop by extending altitude-based calibration sensitivities to a new technical standard for latitude-based methods.
        - Coordinated secured site access, placed and geolocated medallions for future calibration expeditions. 
        - Documented the scientific principles behind absolute gravimetry for geodetic surveyor training purposes.
