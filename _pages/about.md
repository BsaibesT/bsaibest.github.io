<!-- I may not know what I am doing but I am good at it. I am a human doing human things humanly.  -->
I am an experimental physicist interested in precision measurements. I earned my PhD. in physics in 2023 from Purdue Indianapolis School of Science and currently work as a postdoctoral researcher supporting a collaboration between the University of Maryland College Park, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and UC Berkely. The colloboration aims to build an experiment which tests if gravity can induce quantum decoherence. The apparatus will consist of a torsional pendulum acting as a gravitational source mass to trapped atoms; the pendulum will be placed inside the same vacuum chamber as the atoms. If decoherence is caused by grabity, such an experiment could provide bounds on predictions for various quantum approaches to gravity.

<!-- I am a drummer who tries to know something about physics. I earned my PhD. - not in drums - but in physics in 2023. As a PhD candidate at Purdue Indianapolis, I worked in a precision measurement group focused on detecting deviations from Newton’s second law of gravitation between objects at submicron separations. I successfully defended my thesis in 2023 and continue to look for new ways to make contributions to interesting problems. -->


<!-- I am a physicist who recently completed a 1-year SMART Scholarship service commitment at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) as a geodetic surveyor. During my time there, I carried out gravitational surveys and engaged with companies developing quantum based absolute gravimeters. Prior to the NGA, I was a physics PhD candidate at Purdue Indianapolis. His research focused on detecting deviations from Newton’s second law of gravitation for objects at submicron separations. I successfully defended my thesis in 2023 and continue to look for new ways to make contributions to interesting problems. -->

<!-- I am a physicist working with a precision measurement group developing experiments to measure short range interactions. I have been involved in developing a mechanical measurements probing interactions in the submicron regime. I have also been involved in the initial stages of development for an experiment in which a gravitational interaction is used to induce a $$\Pi$$-pulse in a nanosphere. -->
