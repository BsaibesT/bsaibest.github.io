abstract = { Many precision experiments have been done in the Casimir regime and in short range gravity when the separation between the interacting bodies is in the sub-micron range. Experimental complexity is minimized when one of the bodies is a sphere and the other one is a plate, making the alignment between the two bodies ubiquitous. Our group has produced the most precise Casimir measurements, and the best limits on predicted Yukawa-like potentials by measuring a force between a R ∼ 150μm sphere attached to a (500μm)2 micro-mechanical oscillator and a planar source mass. By replacing the spherical surface with a fraction of a 500μm long cylinder with R ∼ 150μm, the force sensitivity can be greatly enhanced. Here, it is paramount to know the angular deviation between the long axis of the cylinder and both the axis of rotation of the oscillator and the plate. Tests between a cylinder and a structure etched into a silicon wafer show that deviations of 20μrad are readily accessible. Additionally, a scaled up experiment is used to investigate if capacitance measurements can determine the orientation of the cylinder with respect to a plane with the required precision. }

abstract  ="Density modulated micro-separated phases (microphases) occur at 2D liquid interfaces in the form of alternating regions of high and low density domains. Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) images demonstrate the existence of microphases in cluster{,} stripe{,} and mosaic morphologies at the buried interface between hexane and water with fluoro-alkanol surfactant dissolved in the bulk hexane. At high temperature{,} the surfactant assembles at the interface in a 2D gaseous state. As the system is cooled additional surfactants condense onto the interface{,} which undergoes a 2D gas–solid phase transition. Microphase structure is observed within a few degrees of this transition in the form of clusters and labyrinthine stripes. Microphases have been observed previously in a number of other systems; nevertheless{,} we demonstrate that adsorption transitions at the liquid–liquid interface provide a convenient way to observe a full sequence of temperature-dependent 2D phases{,} from gas to cluster to stripe to mosaic to inverted stripe phases{,} as well as coexistence between some of these microphases. Cracking and fracture of the clusters reveal that they are a solid microphase. Theories of microphases often predict a single length scale for cluster and stripe phases as a result of the competition between an attractive and a repulsive interaction. Our observation that two characteristic length scales are required to describe clusters whose diameter is much larger than the stripe period{,} combined with the solid nature of the clusters{,} suggests that a long-range elastic interaction is relevant. These results complement earlier X-ray measurements on the same system."

  abstract = {As successful as the Standard Model has been in describing particle interactions, there are still many open questions it does not answer; the strong CP violation and the existence of dark matter among them. To address these issues many extensions to the Standard Model have been devised. Some of these extensions propose a new force mediating particle; a massive particle results in a potential described by a Yukawa-like interaction, while a massless exchange particle leads to power law type potentials. Limits on the strength of these interactions at the sub-micron range of separation between two particles are poorly characterized, but previous experiments conducted at IUPUI placed the best limits to date on the strength of a Yukawa-like interaction. Those experiments used a spherical test mass and a planar source mass. However, if a cylindrical test mass was used, the increased interaction volume of the cylinder would result in an increased sensitivity of about an order of magnitude over the spherical test mass experiment. Building such a system presents many challenges, namely the alignment of the cylinder with respect to the planar source mass. A capacitance based scheme to determine the alignment of a cylinder with respect to a plane will be discussed. The thesis concludes with an outline for a new type of measurement system. The new experiment attempts to induce a gravitational Π-pulse in a nanoshphere to probe extensions to the Standard Model.}

ABSTRACT = {The exchange coupling between two ferromagnetic thin films, one with magnetically hard and the other with soft phases, separated by a thin non-magnetic layer, is studied. Nd-Fe-B/Ti/Fe thin film heterostructures were fabricated using DC magnetron sputtering on Si substrates, which were heated in situ at 650 &deg;C using a house-built vacuum-compatible heater. The effect of the thickness of the Ti buffer layer and the annealing temperature on the formation of various phases of Nd-Fe-B was investigated. The effect of the thickness of the non-magnetic Ti spacer layer on the exchange coupling strength between the hard phase Nd-Fe-B ferromagnetic thin layer and the soft phase transition metal Fe layer was experimentally investigated. Hysteresis loops of multilayer thin films indicate an antiferromagnetic coupling was observed when the thickness of the spacer layer was 2 nm. This is within the range of an antiferromagnetic coupling calculation based on RKKY theory predictions.},
