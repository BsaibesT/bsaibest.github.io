For a cylinder to be a viable test mass in a short range interaction measurement, we need the ability to align it with the source mass. Capacitance can be used as a non-contact method to align a cylindrical test mass with a planar source mass.

Experimental data can be mapped to simulated data to extract the initial separation and angle between a plane and a cylinder. Fitting the experimental data to the simulation requires four fitting parameters: initial height \\(h_0\\), initial angle \\(\theta_0\\), radius of rotation \\(r\\), and offset \\(\delta\\).

The separation and angle are \$$h = h_0 + r(1-\cos(\theta)) - \delta\sin(\theta) + \Delta h$\$ \$$\theta = \theta_0 + \Delta\theta\$$

\\(\Delta h\\) and \\(\Delta\theta\\) are known experimentally. 
Fitting the experimental data to the simulation data is shown below.
